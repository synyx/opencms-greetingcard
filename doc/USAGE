Folder structure:
-----------------
The module data is located under /sites/default/greetingcards. There are three folders:
* archive: contains the sent greetingcards
* content: contains the categories and the greetingcard templates
* MailsToSend: queue for greetingcards to be send later 

The JSPs for the frontend are located in the module directory in elements. If you include them in other templates you have to adjust the links in all jsps. 

Configuration:
--------------
Currently it is a requirement to have a database table configured that can be used to check for existing domains.

The main configuration file is located under /system/modules/com.synyx.greetingcards/conf/configuration. It contains the following fields:
* Database section
** UseWhitelist: when checked only whitelisted domains configured in a database table are allowed
** DatabaseUrl: The connection string for the database containing the whitelist
** DatabaseUser: The username for the database
** DatabasePassword: The password for the database
** TableName: The table containing the whitelist
** ColumnName: The column name containing the domains (e.g. waz.de, synyx.de)
* Thumbnail section
** ThumbnailHeight: The height of the generated thumbnail for greetingcard templates
** ThumbnailWidth: The width of the generated thumbnail for greetingcard templates
** ThumbnailQuality: The quality of the generated thumbnail
* XMLID: The id of the greetingcard schema (only change if also changed in opencms-modules.xml)
* DeleteCardsAfterDays: Days after which the cards are erased completely from VFS (removed from statistics also)
* ArchiveFolder: the folder where the cards can be viewed, send as link in mails
* GreetingcardFolder: the folder containing the greetingcard templates and categories
* TempFolder: the folder containing the mails that are to be send in the future

Creating a greetingcard template:
---------------------------------
The folder /sites/default/greetingcards/content/ (or the one configured) contains folders that are treated as categories for greetincards. To create a new category the following steps have to be performed:
* Create a new folder in /sites/default/greetingcards/content/
* Add the folder to navigation and assign a NavText to it

To create a new greetingcard template:
* Create an XML content of type greeting card
It contains the following fields:
* Image: The background image of the greeting card (a size of 800x600px has proven to be good choice)
* Description
* FontColor
* FontSize
* FontType: by default it can be chosen from all system fonts 
* FontItalic
* FontBold
* FontUnderline
* FontPlain
* PictureTopX: the x coordinate of the top left corner of the box containing the text in the image
* PictureTopY: the y coordinate of the top left corner of the box containing the text in the image
* PictureBottomX: the x coordinate of the bottom right corner of the box containing the text in the image
* PictureBottomY: the y coordinate of the bottom right corner of the box containing the text in the image
* MailText: the text used as mail body of the notification mails

Positioning:
The position of the box needs a little bit training to find a good spot on the image. The coordinates are counted from top left corner, which is (0, 0)

MailText:
Some placeholders are supported to design custom mail bodies. Among those are:
* url: the absolute url where the card can be accessed
* authorName: the name of the sender
* authorMail: the email address of the sender
* receiverName: the name of the recipient
* receiverAddress: the email address of the recipient

Create a greetingcard from template:
------------------------------------
The JSP elements/chooseImage.jsp is the starting point for sending a greetingcard. It presents all categories available. When choosing a category all greetingcard templates of this category are presented as thumbnails. When choosing a greetingcard template you have to insert data. The following fields can be filled out (displayed in german):
* your name: the name of the sender
* your address: the email address of the sender
* name of recipient
* address of recipient (if whitelist is used a dropdown for the allowed domains is presented)
* subject for greetingcard mail
* text for the greetingcard, displayed in the box of the image
* send date (send now or a date in the future)
When data is filled out a preview of the card is presented. If everything is correct, the card can be submitted.

Statistics:
-----------
In administration view there is a new point greetingcard statistics. You can filter the greetingcards sent by internal/external and by date.
